      "In this tutorial, we'll program a more historically accurate version of the Enigma machine. We'll add three components/behaviours:\n",
      "\n",
      "- rotor stepping: the rightmost rotor turns one step at a time\n",
      "- rotor turnover: when the rightmost rotor reaches a notch position, it triggers a step in the middle rotor; similarly when the middle rotor reaches a notch position, it triggers a step in the leftmost rotor.\n",
      "- plugboard (German _stecker_): In German military Enigmas, the operator could connect pairs of letters to add another layer of substitution cipher, which was completely random as compared to the fixed rotors and reflectors. This made the German Enigma code exponentially more difficult to decipher than the commercial versions."
